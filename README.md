In this report, we analyse Hotel H, located in Lisbon, Portugal, with the goal of understanding the key characteristics and behaviours of its existing customers. Our objective is to segment customers geographically, demographically, and behaviourally to develop a comprehensive customer segmentation strategy. This analysis will enable us to provide targeted marketing recommendations to attract new customers while also enhancing engagement with existing guests.

In order to achieve this, we followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which is widely used for planning and executing data mining projects. This approach allows us to gain a deeper understanding of customer needs, identify, collect, and analyse relevant data, perform data preparation, and conclude with the modelling, evaluation, and deployment phases, which we will explain further.

From our clustering analysis, we identified interesting patterns and behaviours that have helped us to tailor targeted marketing initiatives, such as interactive gamification, discounts, free extra night and cultural immersive experience. The main objective of these strategies is to enhance customer satisfaction, improve the hotel reputation by delivering a differentiated experience to the customer and ultimately increase profits. Through all these, we aim to give frequent guests an engaging reason to keep visiting the hotel while also attracting new customers. Additionally, these marketing tactics will help distinguish our hotel from competitors by offering a unique and personalized experience that sets us apart in the market.
